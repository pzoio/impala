<b>Welcome to the Impala web application</b><br/>
<p>This is the <i>Hello World</i> of Impala, just to help you get started. It consists of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A root or main module, which contains interfaces such as <code>MessageService</code> and core domain classes.</li>
<li>A single implementation module, which contains an implementation for <code>MessageService</code> and exports this to Impala's service registry.</li>
<li>A single web module, which uses the message service to get a message to print out to the screen.</li>
</ul>

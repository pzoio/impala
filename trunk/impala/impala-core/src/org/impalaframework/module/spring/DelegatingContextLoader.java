/**
 * {@link DelegatingContextLoader} is used as an alternative strategy for module loading to {@link ModuleLoader}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of {@link DelegatingContextLoader} can be used to back a
 * Spring module for types of modules for which the restrictions which apply for
 * {@link ModuleLoader} implementations is not appropriate. For example, there
 * is a <i>web_placeholder</i> module type, which is backed by an empty
 * instance of {@link org.springframework.web.context.support.GenericWebApplicationContext}, to cover servlet modules
 * which are present in <i>web.xml</i> but not actually backed by any real
 * module functionality.
 * <p>
 * {@link DelegatingContextLoader} could also be used for integrating with
 * Impala specific frameworks which use a Spring application context in a very
 * specialized way, for example, through their own subclass implementations of
 * {@link org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext}. An example might be a framework such as Grails.

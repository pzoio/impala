/**
 * The job of a {@link ModificationExtractor} is to determine what changes are required
 * to convert from the currently loaded module hierarchy (which at pre-load time
 * will be empty), to a desired module hierarchy as determined by a second
 * hierarchy of {@link ModuleDefinition}s.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose module A is the root module and it's child, module B, is
 * loaded. Suppose also that change the desired module hierarchy so that module
 * A will still be loaded, but it will have just one child, module C. The
 * actions that need to take place are: B must be unloaded C must be loaded
 * <p>
 * The advantage of the use of the {@link ModificationExtractor} is that it is possible
 * to edit a module configuration hierarchy offline, then apply it in one go,
 * without having to work out individually what are the module changes required
 * to effect this change.

/**
 * Holds mutable application state held by the Impala runtime. The Impala runtime can 
 * manage multiple {@link Application} instances at a time, but typically only one of these will
 * be active at a time.
 * 
 * There are a number of potential use cases for the capability. One is to allow for seamless implementation of
 * module upgrades. Intead of changing the currently {@link Application} instance, a new {@link Application}
 * instance can be loaded and populated in the background. If and when this is loaded successfully, 
 * requests can be routed to this instance, after which the old instance can be shut down.
 * 
 * Another use case is to allow for multiple virtual applications hosted within the same web container.

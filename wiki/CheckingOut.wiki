#summary Checking Out

= Introduction =

This page describes how to check out Impala, for example, if you want to build Impala from source.

== Checking Out from Trunk ==

The current Impala source repository consists of two workspaces:

  * *impala*: contains the main project source folders and the Wineorder sample.
  * *petclinic*: contains the Petclinic sample. This is a port of the Spring Petclinic application.

To check out the entire source into a new folder called impala-workspaces:

{{{
svn checkout http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ impala-workspaces
}}}

Alternatively, if you only want to check out the Impala workspace, use the following commands:

{{{
mkdir impala-workspaces
cd impala-workspaces
svn checkout http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/impala/ impala
}}}

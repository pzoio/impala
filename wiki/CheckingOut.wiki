#summary How to check the source files out from Impala

== SVN Repository Location ==

http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/

== Checking out from trunk ==

The current Impala source repository consists of two workspaces:

  * *impala*: contains the main project source folders and the Wineorder sample.
  * *petclinic*: contains the Petclinic sample. This is a port of the Spring Petclinic application.

To check out the entire source into a new folder called impala-workspaces:

{{{
svn checkout http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ impala-workspaces
}}}

The source is fairly large (I'll probably moving dependencies out, which will reduce its size), so you'd probably be better checking out one of the two following options:

If you only want to check out just the Impala workspace, use the following commands:

{{{
mkdir impala-workspaces
cd impala-workspaces
svn checkout http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/impala/ impala
}}}

To check out the Petclinic sample workspace, use:

{{{
mkdir petclinic
cd petclinic
svn checkout http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/petclinic/ petclinic
}}}


== Checking out from a particular version ==

Each time a new Impala release is created, a new tag is created in the Impala SVN repository. For example, for the release 1.0M1, a new tagged version of the source corresponding to that release is created in the location:

{{{
http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.0M1
}}}

In order to retrieve source to build this release, simply check out as follows:

{{{
svn checkout http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.0M1 impala-1.0M1-workspaces
}}}

At this point, there is no intention to create source builds. However, source jars are created for each Impala class jar, and included as part of the binary release.

#summary Impala Web Applications

Impala has a lot of features designed to make using and working with web applications as powerful and seamless as possible.
Impala provides flexible deployment options, and supports a large range of scenarios in enabling modular application development.

== Web deployment ==

Impala web applications can be launched in the Eclipse in an embedded Jetty Server. This is powerful, because it means that 
you can do all your web application development without having to run any build scripts. However, war based deployment is also supported.
For more information, see the [GettingStarted tutorial].

== Features ==

Below are some of Impala's web application development features:

  * *modular web applications*: we have the advantages of modularity available for the web tier of our applications just as with any other tier. 
  * *dynamic reloading support for other frameworks*: Impala provides the support not only for Spring MVC-based web applications, but for web applications written using arbitrary Java web frameworks (see the bottom of the page for a caveat on this)
  * *objects held in the `HttpSession` should survive module reloads*, even if the class loader used to load the object originally saved in the session is discarded. See below in this page for more details. 
  
== Initial setup of web application ==

== Developing multi-module applications ==

1) Impala allows you to arrange your web tier modules in a hierarchy. Just as you have a root module for the application as a whole, 
you also have a root module for the web tier, know as the _web root module_. The _web root module_ contains the servlet context resources,
that is, the resources which will be found below the context path in a deployed application, such as styles, images, jsp files, etc.

2) It is also possible to host resources in the modules themselves.

3) Impala provides web application modularity by allowing each module to be represented by at least one filter or servlet.
It is also possible to have multiple filters or servlets servicing requests, per module.

Note that Impala supports two styles of setting up handlers (filters and servlets) for your aplication:
  * [WebXmlHandlerRegistration Standard _web.xml_ based handler registration]. This is simpler getting started but is much more limited in what you can achieve.
  * [WebModuleBasedHandlerRegistration Module based handler registration]. This requires a little more understanding but offers much greater flexibility when developing multi-module applicaitons.
  
== Other Features ==

=== Servlets and Filters ===

Impala provides a number of servlets and filters which you can use in your application for different purposes.

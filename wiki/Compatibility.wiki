= Details =

== 1.0M1 to 1.0M2 ==

 * _Interactive Test Runner_: deprecated the `module` command. To reload an individual module, use `reload %module name%` instead of `module %module name%`.

== 1.0M2 to 1.0M3 ==

 * `WebModuleServlet` and `RootWebModuleServlet`, which gave the capabilities of initializing the module directly from the servlet's _web.xml_, have been removed, in favour of `org.impalaframework.web.servlet.ExternalModuleServlet`, which uses the _moduledefinitions.xml_. This is more flexible and more consistent with other modules.
 * `ModuleManagementFactory` interface has been renamed to `ModuleManagementFacade`

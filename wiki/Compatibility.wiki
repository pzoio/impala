#summary Migration - incompatible changes across versions
#labels Featured

Prior to the final version 1.0 release, backward compatibility cannot be guaranteed. The purpose of this page is to maintain a log of backward incompatible changes made between releases, in order to assist users migrating from versions between 1.0M1 and 1.0 final.

This is not a change log. See the per milestone bug list for changes applying for a particular milestone.

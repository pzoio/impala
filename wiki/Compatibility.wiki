= Introduction =

Prior to the final version 1.0 release, backward compatibility cannot be guarranteed. The purpose of this page is to maintain a log of backward incompatible changes made between releases, in order to assist users migrating from versions between 1.0M1 and 1.0 final.


= Details =

== 1.0M1 to 1.0M2 ==

 * _Interactive Test Runner_: deprecated the `module` command. To reload an individual module, use `reload %module name%` instead of `module %module name%`.

== 1.0M2 to 1.0M3 ==

 * `WebModuleServlet` and `RootWebModuleServlet`, which gave the capabilities of initializing the module directly from the servlet's _web.xml_, have been removed, in favour of `org.impalaframework.web.servlet.ExternalModuleServlet`, which uses the _moduledefinitions.xml_. This is more flexible and more consistent with other modules.
 * `ModuleManagementFactory` interface has been renamed to `ModuleManagementFacade` (SVN 2397)

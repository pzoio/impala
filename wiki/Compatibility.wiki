== 1.0M1 to 1.0M2 ==

*module command renamed*
_Interactive Test Runner_: deprecated the `module` command. To reload an individual module, use `reload %module name%` instead of `module %module name%`.

------

== 1.0M2 to 1.0M3 ==

=== Removed !WebModuleServlet` and !RootWebModuleServlet`=== 
`WebModuleServlet` and `RootWebModuleServlet`, which gave the capabilities of initializing the module directly from the servlet's _web.xml_, have been removed, in favour of `org.impalaframework.web.servlet.ExternalModuleServlet`, which uses the _moduledefinitions.xml_. This is more flexible and more consistent with other modules.

*Action:* If you are using this servlet in web.xml, will need to convert to using one of the other supported servlets.

=== !ModuleManagementFactory renamed=== 
`ModuleManagementFactory` interface has been renamed to `ModuleManagementFacade`. Also `DefaultModuleManagementFactory` (SVN 2398)

This should not affect you unless you are working with the project internals.

=== Renamed folder 'spring'=== 
The module folder *spring*, which contains the module Spring context file and other resources, has now been renamed to *resources* (SVN 2410)

*Action:* In each project, rename the folder 'spring' to 'resources'.

=== Default context location for root module === 
This now follows same convention as other modules (_modulename_-context.xml). 

*Action:* If root module context doesn't explicitly specify context locations, will need to rename the file accordingly.
Alternatively, explicitly set this location by adding _context-locations_ entry in _module.properties_.

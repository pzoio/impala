#summary Migration to 1.0 RC1

A recommended migration task for users moving from Impala 1.0 RC1 from earlier versions is to use the 
new Spring [WebNamespaceHandler web namespace handler], instead of using the factory bean equivalents.

Backward incompatible changes made from 1.0M6 to 1.0 RC1 include:

=== Issue 209 ===

In _impala.properties_, the property that was named `spring.path.mapping.enabled` has been changed to `top.level.module.path.enabled`
as this is a more correct descriptive name. Do a search and replace to correct this.

=== Issue 228 ===

Some of the functionality now present in the WebModuleBaseHandlerRegistration was previously present in a `RequestModuleMapper` implementation
called `TopLevelPathContainsModuleMapper`. This functionality has been removed.

=== Issue 230 ===

One of the module types in 1.0M6 was `servlet`. This module type has been renamed to `web` in Impala 1.0 RC1.

#summary How to add Hibernate to your project

== Background ==

This page describes how to add Hibernate support to your project. The recommended practice is to add Hibernate support in its own module.
Reloading a Hibernate `SessionFactory` can be a relatively time-consuming part of the overall project reload, so it's a good idea to 
separate the module which contains the `SessionFactory` from the one which contains the application DAOs.

== Setup ==

*1) Add a new module*

Add a new 'empty' module to your project, as described in AddingModules.

You will want to give the module a name which clearly identifies it as a 'Hibernate' module.

*2) Add the Hibernate libraries to your project*

*3) Add the Hibernate Spring beans to your module's Spring configuration file.

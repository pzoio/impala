#summary Build scripts used during development

== Building and unzipping to home ==

{{{
cd impala
ant tohome
}}}

Not to apply these to petclinic sample

{{{
cd petclinic
ant fetch
}}}

== Building snapshot ==

Used to build a snapshot of the repository. Will update the svn.revision property in version.properties with the current snapshot number, and create an impala-SNAPSHOT.zip file.

{{{
ant -f release-build.xml snapshot
}}}

== Building release ==

This creates a new release (not a snapshot), but uses the value in the next.release.version property of release-build.properties. Also tags the repository with the current release.

Only run this as part of a real release.

{{{
ant -f release-build.xml release
}}}

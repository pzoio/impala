#summary Impala's Build System

Impala comes with a highly reusable build system, based (surprisingly to some) on ANT.

The build system will be available if you install Impala locally, that is, if you
download Impala and set up an environment variable `IMPALA_HOME` pointing to the install location.

You don't need to use Impala's build system to use Impala. In fact, you don't need any 
build support in place if you simply want to test your application in the IDE.
However, you will need build support to deploy your application externally, and for this
you may want to take a look at Impala's build system.

== Master Build project ==

The default when creating a new Impala project is to create it with a _build_ project, which ]
is in effect the master build project. Each project can be built separately and individually -
but only the master build project is able to build all of the projects in the application.

Let's consider the build XML in the master build project.

{{{

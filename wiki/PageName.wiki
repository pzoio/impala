= Petclinic Sample =

The Petclinic sample is based on the Spring Petclinic 2.0.x sample, with a few minor modifications. The principal modification is that the application has been divided into a number of modules:

  * a _main_ module
  * a _hibernate_ module
  * a _dao_ module
  * a _web_ module

{{{
svn co https://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/petclinic petclinic
}}}

Then open an Eclipse workspace in the new _petclinic_ folder, and import all the projects into the workspace.

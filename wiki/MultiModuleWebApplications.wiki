#summary Developing multi-module web applications

= Overview =

Basically, the idea behind the multi-module web application is to reduce dependency on the web.xml (which is static, cannot be reloaded or added
to). Instead, Impala allows you to delegate requests to modules, and allow these modules to host filters, servlets, resources, etc.
Indeed, it is possible to reduce your dependency on web.xml to bootstrapping Impala and to provide a catch-all filter mapping.
This style of development is illustrated in the [SamplesURLMapping URL mapping sample].

#summary Interfaces used internally within Impala

== Introduction ==

As a casual user of the framework you will rarely need to use the interfaces described below. However, when extending Impala, or developing Impala,
and occasionally when debugging, knowledge of these interfaces can be very useful indeed.

As background for this discussion, it is helpful to bear in mind the processes and operations involved when loading and managing modules.

= Impala Roadmap =

The following gives an outline of some of the features which are envisaged, post Impala 1.0.
  .
=== Documentation and Samples ===
  * *_Whistle and bells_ samples*. Impala really shines when dealing with large applications with complex configuration requirements. It would be great to have a more advanced sample application which demonstrates it's capabilities. 
  * *More documentation*.

=== Features ===
  * *Web administration tool* for visualising and administering modules at runtime.
  * *Module plugins.* Provide a packaging structure which will allow for chunks of reusable functionality to be packaged and deployed within a module, potentially using custom module type.

=== Integration ===
  * *Scala support*, with built in support in Impala build for compiling Scala classes.
  * *Groovy support*, with a simple mechanism for picking up Groovy scripts and exposing these as part of module functionality.
  * *Integration with Grails. Either with Impala embedded within Grails, Grails embedded within Impala, or both.

=== IDE ===
  * *IDE integration* (IntelliJ, Netbeans). Currently, Eclipse is explicitly supported, for example, in the documentation, samples and scaffolding. It would be good to provide support for IntelliJ, Netbeans and potentially JDeveloper.
  * *Eclipse plugin for interactive test runner.
  * *Eclipse WST platform* support.

=== Build ===
  * *Better Maven build support*, allowing Maven users to build Impala applications using Maven, and to structure projects according to Maven document structure conventions.
  * *Maven archetypes*, for creating new modules.

=== JMX ===
  * *Extensions to JMX administration capability*. Currently, JMX can be used for certain administration functions. The idea would be to extend this capability, and also improve on the range and sophistication of JMX deployment options
  * *Further extensions to the JMX support.

=== Deployment ===
  * *New deployment options, for example via Amazon's EC2 service.

=== Testing ===
  * *JUnit 4.0 support*. Specifically, the interactive test runner should be usable with JUnit 4.0-based tests.

=== Web === 
  * *Further web framework integration*. Target additional web frameworks not covered in 1.0 release.

=== OSGi ===
  * *Better OSGi support*, including support for web applications, easier OSGi integration testing, and better out the box OSGi deployment. 
  * *Extensions to the Service registry API*, potenially allowing for OSGi compatibility when exporting and looking up service registry.

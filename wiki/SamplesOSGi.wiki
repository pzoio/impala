#summary OSGi sample application

= OSGi sample =

This sample is designed as a testbed for Impala's OSGI support.
As of release 1.0M4 this is still preliminary/experimental.

== Project setup ==

The easiest way to access the examples is to check them out directly from trunk.

{{{
svn co http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/osgi-sample osgi-sample
}}}

Then open an Eclipse workspace in the new _osgi-sample_ folder, and import all the projects into the workspace.

== Run the sample ==

From within Eclipse, run `MessageIntegrationTest`, `OsgiContextTest` or `ReloadTest`.
As of release 1.0M4 running these in a suite is still not supported.

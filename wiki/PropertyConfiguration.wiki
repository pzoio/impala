#summary Impala Configuration Properties

The properties described on this page are used to set the built-in configuration options, typically found in _impala.properties_,
but which can also be set using system properties, and in web applications, using _web.xml_ `init-parameter` entries.

=== Core Properties ===

The following properties are relevant for both standalone and web Impala runtime environments.

*all.locations	*: A comma or space separated list of context locations. If this property is set, then other properties which would otherwise
be used to determine which Impala application context XML files to include will be ignored. The value set in this file is taken as
the truth. Note that if the value does not end in .xml, the it is assumed to take the form impala-suppliedname.xml. In other words,
_impala-_ is used as a prefix, and _.xml_ is used as a suffix. See BootstrapContexts for more details on how these context locations are used.

*bootstrapLocations*: An alias for all.locations.

*extra.locations*: Used to add additional context locations. Use when you want simply want to add one more context locations to the set which would 
otherwise be used. Note that if the value does not end in .xml, the it is assumed to take the form impala-suppliedname.xml. In other words,
_impala-_ is used as a prefix, and _.xml_ is used as a suffix. See BootstrapContexts for more details on how these context locations are used.

*classloader.type*: The module management type to be used. Permissible values are _shared_, _hierarchical_ and _graph_. 
The default value is _graph_.

*graph.bean.visibility.type*: Indicates the visibility type of Spring beans when using the graph class
loader. Permissible values are _none_, _graphOrdered_,
_parentFirst_ and _parentOnly_.

*parent.classloader.first*: This is used to specify whether Impala should attempt to load classes by first checking the application or system class path, 
before examining the module class path. The default is _true_.

----
=== Web Properties ===

The following properties are relevant when running Impala as a web application.

*auto.reload.modules*: Whether modules should be automatically reloaded if the file/directory
containing the modules has modified. If true, a background thread will
monitor module files/folders and automatically reload modules when
changes are detected. Default is `false`.

*partitioned.servlet.context*: Whether `ServletContext` attributes and resources should be partitioned
across modules. This makes it possible to set attributes and make resources
visible within modules only through {@link ServletContext} methods.

*session.module.protection*: Attempt to protect session state when module is reloaded. If class loader
which loaded original object in session is replaced, the object in
session will no longer be visible to application code once module is
reloaded. The solution is to clone the object via Java serialization,
replacing the class loader of session object during the cloning process.
The cloned object is then added to the session in place of the old object
with the stale class loader.

*embedded.mode*: This property must be set to true if you want to run a web application
embedded within the IDE, without any specific packaging required.
Suitable for a fast develop/deploy/test cycle. The alternative involves
creating a war file with modules placed in jars files in
_WEB-INF/modules_. This is the default, and is the valid production
setting.

*preserve.session.on.reload.failure*: If a session attribute is lost because it cannot be "reloaded" maintain the 
existing session. Default is `true`.

*spring.path.mapping.enabled*:

*web.module.prefix*:

*top.level.module.suffixes*:

----

=== JMX Properties ===

*expose.jmx.operations*: if set to true, then Impala's JMX operations are exposed. If set to false, then no 
Impala-specific beans will be exported. Default is `true`.

*jmx.locate.existing.server*: Spring provides a mechanism which allows for an existing MBean server to be located. This is useful, 
in particular, when running Impala in an application server which hosts a JMX environment. One limitation however, is that 
only one Impala application which uses JMX can be configured in this way on a single application server instance. The reason is that
each of Impala application will attempt to use the same JMX bean name for the respective expored JMX beans. Defaults to `false`.

*expose.mx4j.adaptor*: Set this property to true to use the MX4J console. The MX4J classes must be present on the class path. If you are
using the application server's native JMX console via the `jmx.locate.existing.server` property, then you probably won't want to set this
property. Defaults to `false`. 

*jmx.adaptor.port*: If the MX4J console is used, it can be accessed via HTTP server using a separate port. Use this property to change
the port used from the default of 8001.

----
	 
=== Build Properties ===	 
	
The following properties relate to the Impala build configuration. Unlike the other property sets above, they are set in _build.properties_.	

*workspace.root*: The module root directory, used as the base location when looking for module jars or directories.

*module.class.dir*: The directory or jar relative to `workspace.root` in which to find modules.

*module.test.dir*: The version of the application. Used, for example, when searching for module jar files. For example, if version is 1.1
then `mymodule` may be found in a jar file called `mymodule-1.1.jar`.

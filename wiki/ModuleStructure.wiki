#summary Page describing the internal contents of different types of modules.

It is important to understand the role of the different files that are present in the modules. We'll use the Petclinic example application to show the internal structure of modules. The projects contained in the Petclinic example are shown below:

The Petclinic application has been divided into a main or root module (_petclinic_), two application modules (_petclinic-hibernate_ and _petclinic-service_), and a web module ( _petclinic-web_). A real world application would probably have quite a few more modules. Perhaps a dozen or so application modules, a root web module, and a number of servlet modules for dividing the web portion of the application into logic elements.

Notice also there are an additional two projects which are not modules. These are:

  * _petclinic-repository_: used to contain the third party libraries used for the application.
  * _petclinic-tests_: a convenience project whose primary purpose is to run the suites of tests for all modules as a single JUnit suite run within the IDE.

In the next section, we'll describe in a bit more detail the internal structure of each of the module types.

== Main or root module ==

The structure of the main module is shown below.

The _src_ and _test_ folders contain (mostly Java) source and test files respectively, as with pretty much any other Java project. 
_resources_ contains additional resources for the project, such as the module's Spring configuration files (here simply _parent-context.xml_), as well as other resources which might need to be found on the classpath.

Note that the contents of both _src_ and _resources_ will end up in the same classes folder or Jar at runtime. Splitting them is just a convenience to 
allow you to separate Java source from other resources.

Files in _test_ are not intended to end up as module contents.

#summary Understanding Impala's module class loader

The main class loader used in Impala is [GraphClassLoader http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/impala/impala-core/src/org/impalaframework/classloader/graph/GraphClassLoader.java]
which takes that name because it supports dependencies between modules arranged in a graph, rather than simply a hierarchical or tree-style relationship.

== An example ==

Impala's Graph class loader allows you to express dependencies between modules in the form of a graph. What does this mean.

=== Hierarchical relationships ===

Suppose you have a root module A, which has children B and C. In this case
  * The classes in module A will be visible to classes in modules B and C. 
  * However, the classes in B will not be visible to the classes in C, and vice versa.
  * Also, the classes in B will not be visible to A, and neither will the classes in C be visible to A.
  
What I describe above is a hierarchical relationship, shown below:

It allows class loader relationships to be expressed on a parent child basis.

=== Graph-based relationships ===

While this offers a fair amount of flexibility, it is not really sufficient for many real world applications.

Suppose we introduce a new module D, which we would like to be a child of B. However, suppose we would like 
some of the classes that we define in D to also depend on classes in C. With a simple parent to child or hiearchical relationship, 
this is not possible. Instead, we need a graph based relationship, which allows classes in individual modules to have
visibility of classes from multiple dependent modules.

#summary Page describing how to set up module configuration

== Basic Module Configuration ==

The easiest way to set up a module is through the file _module.properties_. Each module configured in this way will have _module.properties_ sitting
in the root directory of the module's class path. In practice, this means placing _module.properties_ in the module's _resources_ folder.

=== module.properties ===

An example of _module.properties_ is shown below:

{{{
parent=petclinic
type=servlet
context-locations=petclinic-web-context.xml
}}}

This example is taken from the web module definition of the Impala Petclinic application.

*_parent_:* the name of the parent module. This property is required for all modules apart from the root module. 
Remember that each module typically is backed both by its own class loader, and it's own Spring application context.
The relationship between the child
and the parent typically applies both for the class loader and the application context. This means that classes defined in the parent
module are visible to child modules, but not vice versa. Similarly, beans accessible through the parent's `ApplictionContext` are accessible to 
beans in the child's `ApplicationContext`, and not vice versa.

*_type_:* the type of the module. The type of the module governs both the mechanism for loading module definitions, and the mechanism for loading the module, that is
the resources for the module as well as its `ApplicationContext`.

The following types are available out of the box:

||_root:_ || Associated with the root module. This may be backed by the system class or application class loader, or by an Impala custom class loader, depending on the configuration. It will also be backed by a Spring `GenericApplicationContext`.||
||_application:_ || The module type used for most other non-web modules. Typically backed by an Impala custom class loader and a Spring `GenericApplicationContext`.||
||_application_with_beansets:_ || Impala includes a mechanism for overriding bean import definitions in quite a sophisticated way, which can be easily customised via an external configuration. For small to medium-sized modules, this feature is unlikely to be useful.||
||_servlet_:|| This is Impala's main form of web module. It is backed by a `GenericWebApplicationContext` instance, and by an Impala custom class loader. Web modules can be arranged in a hierarchy. However, there can only be one 'root' web module. This module will also contain web application files, such as the _WEB-INF/web.xml_ as well CSS styles, images, etc.||
||_web_root_:|| Similar to the _servlet_ module. There are two main differences. Firstly, _servlet_ modules follow the convention of having Spring configuration files located as class path resources, while _web_root_ modules are found as servlet context resources, that is, relative to the `ServletContext` root directory. The first is consistent with Impala's typical usage, while the latter is closer to the convention of vanilla Spring applications, which use the _servlet-name_ plus _servlet_ suffix convention to locate Spring config files.||
||_web_placeholder_: || This is a special type of module which can be used in some configurations to 'turn off' the functionality that would otherwise be provided by a servlet module. The usage of this type of module is explained in WebConfiguration.||


It's pretty straightforward to add new module types. You will need to override the `typeReaders` bean in the Impala Spring configuration, as well as the 
`moduleLoaders` property of the `moduleLoaderRegistry` Impala Spring bean.


== Internal Details ==

An Impala module is represented by an instance of `ModuleDefinition`. The mechanism

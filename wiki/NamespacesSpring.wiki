#summary Impala Spring Namespaces

Impala includes a number of Spring namespaces which make it easier to configure the Impala-specific aspects of 
your Spring application when working with Impala.

  * [NamespaceReferenceService service namespace] 
  Used for exporting and importing services from the service registry and other convenience elements for managing Spring bean references.
  * [NamespaceWebReference web namespace] 
  Used for defining web module mappings as well as servlets and filters used within modules.
  * [NamespaceDynamicProperties dynaprop (dynamic properties) namespace] 
  Used for setting up dynamic properties, allowing for on the fly configuration updates to injected properties without requiring module reloads.

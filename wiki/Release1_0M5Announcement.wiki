#summary 1.0M5 Release Announcement

Impala 1.0M5 is primarily a consolidation release, introduces many API and configuration improvements into the framework.
Following 1.0M5, only minor changes in internal APIs are now expected prior to the 1.0 final release. 

The 1.0M5 release features improvements which make it much easier to configure Impala-based applications, and to 
add your own extensions to the framework. While Impala is still very heavily based on the Spring framework, 1.0M5 now 
also makes it possible to plug in other runtime frameworks into Impala's dynamic loading mechanism.

The full list of issues for milestone 1.0M5 is here:  http://code.google.com/p/impala/issues/list?q=label:Milestone-Release1.0M5&can=1.

Note that there are a number of package name and configuration changes in this release.
If you are upgrading from an earlier release, you will probably wish to check for [Compatibility non-compatible changes].

# Examples sample #

The example sample is not really designed as a showcase of Impala for users, but more a testbed for features aimed a Impala developers.

## Project setup ##

The easiest way to access the examples is to check them out directly from trunk.

```
svn co http://impala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/example-sample example-sample
```

Then open an Eclipse workspace in the new _example-sample_ folder, and import all the projects into the workspace.

## Run the sample ##

From within Eclipse, run StartServer as a web application. Then connect using the URL:

http://localhost:8080/example-host/

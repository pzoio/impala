        <h1>Impala Web Framework Integration Example</h1>
        
        <p>This page is the index page for the online demonstration of Impala's web framework support. The application consists of web modules for 
        Struts 1, Tapestry5 and Wicket. Each of these applications is configured either using a Servlet or Filter which is declared in it's own 
        module. Requests are intercepted and forwarded to the correct module using a single Filter/Servlet pair.</p>
        
        <p><b>The example shows how tight integration with Impala can be achieved for arbitrary Java web frameworks, allowing 
        web framework code as well as back end modules to be reloaded on a running JVM</b>.</p>
        
        <p><i>This means that you can benefit from Impala while
        still using your favourite web framework. You're not restricted to using Spring MVC.</i>
        </p>
        
        <p>In general, only minor tweaks are required to support the integration. 
        </p>
        
        <p>The Struts example demonstrates how items held in the session can be preserved across module reloads, even when the classloader used to 
        load the object held in the session has been replaced. This allows for continuity of sessions across module reloads. 
        </p>
        
        <p>In both the Wicket and Tapestry examples, Spring beans are injected into the page. Beans can either be from the defining module, or 
        from parent modules.

        <p>Modules can be reloaded using the JMX console. Also, Impala can be configured to automatically detect changes in modules and reload these, 
        as required.

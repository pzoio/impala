/**
 * Interface representing strategy to find the class path locations of a
 * particular module as a list of {@link Resource}s.
 * 
 * {@link ModuleLocationResolver} is responsible for determining where to find
 * modules. Impala supports a number of deployment configurations, such as
 * standalone deployment of jar files, deployment of modules as jar files in a
 * web application's <i>WEB-INF/modules_ directory</i>, and deployment directly from
 * the _bin_ directory of an Eclipse project on the file system. Each of these
 * scenarios requires a different strategy for module loading, and hence a
 * different implementation of {@link ModuleLocationResolver}
